## Concept Development

### Product Function

The smart mouthguard is a wireless-enabled nighttime dental appliance, which integrates multiple sensors to monitor bruxism, oral condition and sleep position changes.

### Target Market & Demographics

1. Who will be using your product?

**Primary Users:** Individuals suffering from bruxism, TMJ disorders, or sleep-related dental issues, representing about 8-10% of the adult population.

**Secondary Users:** Health-conscious consumers seeking comprehensive sleep tracking beyond wristbands or bedside monitors.

**Tertiary Users:** Researchers and clinical institutions conducting sleep studies or investigating oral-systemic health connections.

2. Who will be purchasing your product?

Dental patients(direct consumer purchase, often through dentists).

Dentists, orthodontists, and sleep specialists who provide the device as part of treatment packages.

Research institutions and hospitals purchasing in bulk for clinical studies.

3. Where in the world would you deploy your product?

Initial deployment: United States, due to high awareness of sleep health and strong dental appliance adoption.

Expansion market: Europe(Germany, UK, Scandinavia for high oral appliance use) and East Asia(China, South Korea, Japan), where bruxism and sleep disorders are rising.

4. How large is the market you're targeting, in US dollars?

The potential market for the smart mouthguard lies at the intersection of the bruxism treatment/management market and the broader sleep technology devices market.

**Bruxism Treatment/Management Market:**

Estimates vary depending on scope. For example, Coherent Market Insights reports a conservative global market size of USD 1.38 billion in 2025, with a CAGR of ~6.6% (2025–2032). Broader definitions of bruxism management, which include oral appliances and monitoring solutions, are valued higher: Future Market Insights projects USD 7.2 billion in 2025, growing to USD 14 billion by 2035 at ~6.9% CAGR. Similarly, Reanin estimates the global bruxism management market at USD 6.3 billion in 2024, expected to surpass USD 10 billion by 2031 (CAGR ~7.1%). Taken together, these reports suggest that the bruxism-related market should be conservatively considered a multi-billion-dollar industry.

**Sleep Technology Devices Market:**
This broader market is significantly larger and rapidly growing. Grand View Research valued the global sleep tracking devices market at USD 26.6 billion in 2023, projected to reach USD 58.2 billion by 2030 (CAGR ~11.7%). Maximize Market Research estimated USD 19.5 billion in 2024, with forecasts of ~USD 56 billion by 2032 (CAGR ~14.9%). Precedence Research reports USD 24.9 billion in 2024, with expected growth to USD 134.6 billion by 2034 (CAGR ~18.5%). These consistent estimates position sleep technology devices as a tens-of-billions-dollar market with strong growth momentum.

**Conclusion:**

Based on industry data, the target market size for the smart mouthguard can be credibly positioned as a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, grounded in the overlap between bruxism treatment and sleep technology markets. Therefore, we conservatively estimates the traget market size will be 5 billions.

5. How much of that market do you expect to capture, in US dollars?

In the early commercialization stage, we adopt a conservative assumption of capturing only 0.1% of the global sleep technology devices market (≈ USD 5 billion). This results in an estimated annual revenue of approximately USD 5 million within 3–5 years. Such a figure is realistic for an early-stage IoT healthcare device, reflecting the time required for regulatory clearance, user adoption, and clinical validation.

Looking ahead, if clinical trials demonstrate reliability and physicians integrate the device into standard treatment pathways, our obtainable market share could expand toward 0.5–1% of the combined bruxism management and sleep technology markets (USD 20 billion). Under this scenario, annual revenues could exceed USD 100 million, driven by adoption across both consumer wellness channels and medical/dental professional networks.

6. What competitors are ready in the space.

**GrindRelief Pro / traditional night guards** – provide protection but no data tracking.

**Fitbit / Oura Ring / WHOOP** – track sleep but lack oral health integration.

**SomnoDent / ProSomnus** – FDA-cleared oral appliances for sleep apnea, but not designed for multi-sensor monitoring.

Our differentiator: multi-modal oral cavity sensing + wireless data integration, uniquely combining protection, monitoring, and analytics.

### Stakeholders

Based on the above market analysis, key stakeholders include:

**End users (patients with bruxism, TMJ, or sleep disorders):** They validate usability, comfort, and willingness to adopt a mouth-based wearable.

**Dentists, orthodontists, and sleep specialists:** They act as prescribers and distribution partners, and need reliable data integration into clinical workflows.

**Healthcare institutions & research centers:** Potential early adopters for clinical trials, validating accuracy and expanding medical credibility.

**Regulatory advisors (FDA consultants, dental device compliance experts):** To ensure device clearance as a medical/dental appliance.

**Health-conscious consumers interested in advanced personal health monitoring:** They represent an early adopter group outside the patient population, validating consumer desirability and driving awareness in the wellness market.

We have already identified potential stakeholder directions: for example, **Edward Steager** in GRASP Lab is interested in advanced personal oral health monitoring. Professor **Pamela Z. Cacchione** in Penn Nursing is also interested in our idea, especially in the aspect of detecting sleep disorder. Professor **Kyle Vining** in school of dental medicine also considers our project to be very promising.
